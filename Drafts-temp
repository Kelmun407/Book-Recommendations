Based on your project, I'll create a Dockerfile and docker-compose file that uses the official Node.js image as the base, which is lightweight and well-maintained.

Here's a draft of the Dockerfile:
```
# Use the official Node.js image as the base
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package*.json files to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port for the Express server
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the command to start the Express server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
And here's a draft of the docker-compose file:
```
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
```
These files assume that your Express server listens on port 3000, which is the default port. If you're using a different port, please let me know.

Please review these drafts and let me know if you'd like me to make any changes before I finalize the files.
